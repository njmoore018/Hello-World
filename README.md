# Overview

This program has been created to demonstrate my ability to create git repositories, connect to github, and share the code I have written online. For this demonstration I have chosen to write a simple "Hello World" program in Python.

This program simply prints out the statement, "Hello World!".

You can view a demonstration video of my code here: [Software Demo Video](https://youtu.be/eQJ6T0CKKis)
